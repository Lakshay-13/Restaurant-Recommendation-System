# Restaurant-Recommendation-System

Aim - To build a restaurant recommendation based on yelp dataset using various techniques.

Introduction -
We got our dataset from yelp. The dataset contains 5 tables namely

1.Business
2.User
3.Review
4.Checkin
5.Tip

Reading the dataset from a tar file , and then converting it to CSV files.
We performed EDA on the dataset and then came up with a plan of action.
Firstly, we used item-item collaborative based filtering using cosine similarity.
Second, we used embeddings of latent factors using stoichastic gradient descent.
Last but not the least, we implemented a hybrid of the above two.
